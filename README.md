# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Anyone can compose a new tweet which currently gets assigned a random user and persists to the tweets database.

This app was built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the front-end, and Node, Express and MongoDB on the back-end.
